			In its purest form, dance is an art.  
			After hundreds or thousands of hours of work, the choreographer and dancers present their ephemeral art for the audience to interpret.  
			The curtain rises, the dancers dance; the curtain falls, the attendees clap.  
			What the audience members rarely ponder, however, is the work that went into the performance: the potentially unartful and stressful auditions, rehearsals, and meetings that brought the art to life.  
			Watching my friend Morgan go through multiple seasons with the Columbia Ballet Collaborative (CBC) has been an eye-opening experience for me.  
			In mid-October, I had the opportunity to attend CBCâ€™s Works In Progress, which showcased a few minutes from each of the six pieces planned for their November 15 show.  
			As I watched small snippets of all of the pieces, including an actual rehearsal process for one of them, I found myself drawing parallels between the dance development process and the technological startup scene.
