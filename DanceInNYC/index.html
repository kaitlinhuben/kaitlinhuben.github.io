			After hundreds or thousands of hours of work, the choreographer and dancers present their ephemeral art for the audience to interpret.
			<br><br>
			The curtain rises, the dancers dance; the curtain falls, the attendees clap.
			<br><br> 
			What the audience members rarely ponder, however, is the work that went into the performance: the potentially unartful and stressful auditions, rehearsals, and meetings that brought the art to life.
			<br><br>
			Watching my friend Morgan go through multiple seasons with the <a href="http://www.columbiaballetcollaborative.com/">Columbia Ballet Collaborative</a> (CBC) has been an eye-opening experience for me.
			<br><br>
			In mid-October, I had the opportunity to attend CBCâ€™s Works In Progress, which showcased a few minutes from each of the six pieces planned for their <a href="http://www.columbiaballetcollaborative.com/performances.html">November 15 show</a>.
			<br><br>
			As I watched small snippets of all of the pieces, including an actual rehearsal process for one of them, I found myself drawing parallels between the dance development process and the technological startup scene.
