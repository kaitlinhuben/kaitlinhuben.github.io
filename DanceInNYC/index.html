				<li><b>In its purest form, dance is an art.</b></li>
				<li>After hundreds or thousands of hours of work, the choreographer and dancers present their ephemeral art for the audience to interpret.</li>
				<li>The curtain rises, the dancers dance; the curtain falls, the attendees clap.</li> 
				<li>What the audience members rarely ponder, however, is the work that went into the performance: the potentially unartful and stressful auditions, rehearsals, and meetings that brought the art to life.</li>
				<li>Watching my friend Morgan go through multiple seasons with the <a href="http://www.columbiaballetcollaborative.com/">Columbia Ballet Collaborative</a> (CBC) has been an eye-opening experience for me.</li>
				<li>In mid-October, I had the opportunity to attend CBC's Works In Progress, which showcased a few minutes from each of the six pieces planned for their <a href="http://www.columbiaballetcollaborative.com/performances.html">November 15 show</a>.</li>
				<li>As I watched small snippets of all of the pieces, including an actual rehearsal process for one of them, I found myself drawing parallels between the dance development process and the technological startup scene.</li>

					I.	You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend as little money as possible.

				<li><b>For a dance piece or startup to be successful, it seems that many things must fall into place.</b></li>
			  </ul>
			  <ul class="content-list right-60">
				<li><b>Startups are a marvel of the modern technological world.</b></li>
				<li>Like Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak selling Apple computers from their garage, Bill Gates founding his company Microsoft, or Tony Hsieh keeping Zappos afloat in the 1990s, a programmer with the right knowledge in the right place at the right time can make a splash in the tech scene.</li>
				<li>That requires a lot of "right"s, though, something that only happens for <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4853121.Mahendra_Ramsinghani ">0.5 percent of the 600,000 startups</a> launched every year.</li>
				<li>Newly created dances are not much different.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <div class="clear"></div>
			  <ul class="content-list left-30">
				<li><b>First and foremost, a choreographer needs to "start with good people" â€“ namely, his or her dancers.</b></li>
				<li>At auditions, a choreographer needs to convince dancers that his piece is worth dancing, that he has a vision the dancers can embrace and expand.</li>
				<li>One of the pieces at Works In Progress involves the use of ten-pound weights attached to nylon ropes.</li>
				<li>Morgan came back from auditions one hundred percent certain she did not want to be dancing in that piece.</li>
				<li>She didn't click with the choreographer, she said, and she thought the idea of weights was crazy.</li>
				<li>Investors thought selling shoes online was a wacky idea, too, but Zappos has gone on to make billions of dollars in sales every year since 2008.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <ul class="content-list left-30" style="padding-left: 5%">
				<li><b>Like a good startup CEO, a choreographer must also "make something the customers actually want."</b></li>
				<li>In the case of dance, customers are audience members, and what they want depends on the choreographer's intended audience demographic.</li>
				<li>This point does offer some flexibility, however.</li>
				<li>Just as technological firms have to develop for what the customer actually needs as opposed to what the customer thinks he needs, choreographers can push the boundaries of what the audience members are willing to watch.</li>
				<li>Modern choreographers like Trisha Brown can develop dances that expand the minds of those watching (without necessarily holding their hands), just as Apple tries to develop devices that make technology use as intuitive as possible.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <ul class="content-list right-30">
				<li><b>Finally, there is the money situation.</b></li>
				<li>Unless they attract the attention of venture capital (VC) firms or so-called "angel investors," startups have a critically small amount of time in which to succeed or fail.</li>
				<li>Dance groups, unless they can wheedle adequate money from federal and local grants, are on their own to acquire the funds needed to continue dancing.</li>
				<li>There's a saying in tech: "fail fast and fail often."</li>
				<li>That is simply not an option if failing means you can't try again.</li>

				<li>Many startups have similar goals in mind: search the Internet efficiently, make a social networking site, or create a successful e-commerce website, to name a few.</li>
				<li><b>The companies that stand out, however, are those that solved these problems <em>best</em>.</b></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press-Releases/2013/8/comScore-Releases-July-2013-US-Search-Engine-Rankings ">Sixty-seven percent of web searches</a> go through Google; <a href="http://visual.ly/how-many-people-use-facebook-2013-update-3-october-2013">five hundred million people</a> use Facebook; Zappos stocks over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zappos">fifty thousand varieties of shoes</a>, in addition to their non-shoe merchandise.</li>
				<li>There were (and are) plenty of other companies trying to tackle these problems:
					<ul class="sub-list">
						<li><em>Search algorithms:</em> Yahoo, Microsoft's Bing, and more (although <a href="http://searchengineland.com/googles-eric-schmidts-berlin-speech-biggest-search-competitor-amazon-205761">Google views Amazon as its biggest competitor</a>)
						<li><em>Social media:</em> Myspace, StumbleUpon, Bebo, and more</li>
						<li><em>E-commerce;</em> Amazon's <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/lydiadishman/2012/09/27/amazons-endless-experiment-is-over-but-its-still-competing-with-zappos/">endless.com, launched in 2007</a> as a direct Zappos competitor, as well as plenty of others</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>There's a reason these may not sound familiar. The ingredients - in this case, problems and solutions - weren't new. Google, Facebook, and Zappos just found innovative ways to mix them up.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <ul class="content-list right-47">
				<li><b>The human body can only move in so many ways before breaking.</b></li>
				<li>Choreographers have a limited, though expansive, set of ingredients - movements - with which to work.</li>
				<li>It is the way in which they combine the movements that either lulls us to sleep or brings us out of our chairs with applause.</li>
				<li>Like startup companies focusing on a smaller computing problem, choreographers often select a subset of motion:
					<ul class="sub-list">
						<li><em>George Balanchine:</em> ballet with a touch of modern</li>
						<li><em>Trisha Brown:</em> modern, to the point of pedestrian</li>
						<li><em>Vuyani Dance Theater:</em> spiritual, non-Western movements</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>A choreographer doesn't need to do everything: she just needs to choreograph her subset of movements well, in a way that connects with her audience.</li>

					IV.	Sitting in on a rehearsal by a professional dance company is a privilege...

				<li>The small audience in attendance at CBC's Works In Progress was treated to snippets of each of the six pieces.</li>
				<li>There was no Playbill for Works In Progress; we heard about the background of each piece from the choreographers themselves.</li>
				<li>Startups don't have a Playbill either: they don't necessarily have a structure to follow, but must figure out the right path for themselves.</li>
				<li><b>While most choreographers showed us polished moments of their pieces, only one chose to actually rehearse in front of us.</b></li>
				<li>This was the second to last piece, choreographed by Richard Isaac, a student at the School of General Studies. It doesn't currently have a name, but is based on fourteenth century Spanish court dances.</li>
				</ul>
			  <ul class="content-list left-30" style="padding-left: 5%">
				<li>As Richard entered Studio 1, he began telling us about the artistic process that inspired his piece.</li>
				<li>The dancers tentatively peeked into the room; he encouraged them in with a wave as he continued talking to us. The dancers warmed up behind him.</li>
				<li>After his quick overview of his creative process, he turned to work with the dancers for a few minutes.</li>
				<li>One, a lanky redhead, practiced a solo to the right of the room; the other three were on their backs, practicing a head turn that lifted their bodies off the ground as if a puppeteer were lifting their chests.</li>
				<li>As Richard worked with the three dancers rolling on the floor, I started drawing the parallels with startup tech companies.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <ul class="content-list right-30">
				<li>The internal startup development process is rarely revealed to outsiders; while watching a dance rehearsal may be a privilege, the startup process is often carefully guarded and only experienced by those directly involved in it.</li>
				<li>If startups want to gain mainstream recognition, however, they need to go public.</li>
				<li>If dances are to continue to be performed, they need to gain a foothold with a receptive audience.</li>
				<li>Peeking into the rehearsal process is a unique opportunity to watch the decisions behind the direction the piece takes.</li>
				<li>Perhaps startups could benefit from similar early public exposure.</li>
