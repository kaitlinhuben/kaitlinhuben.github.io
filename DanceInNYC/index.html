				<li><b>In its purest form, dance is an art.</b></li>
				<li>After hundreds or thousands of hours of work, the choreographer and dancers present their ephemeral art for the audience to interpret.</li>
				<li>The curtain rises, the dancers dance; the curtain falls, the attendees clap.</li> 
				<li>What the audience members rarely ponder, however, is the work that went into the performance: the potentially unartful and stressful auditions, rehearsals, and meetings that brought the art to life.</li>
				<li>Watching my friend Morgan go through multiple seasons with the <a href="http://www.columbiaballetcollaborative.com/">Columbia Ballet Collaborative</a> (CBC) has been an eye-opening experience for me.</li>
				<li>In mid-October, I had the opportunity to attend CBC's Works In Progress, which showcased a few minutes from each of the six pieces planned for their <a href="http://www.columbiaballetcollaborative.com/performances.html">November 15 show</a>.</li>
				<li>As I watched small snippets of all of the pieces, including an actual rehearsal process for one of them, I found myself drawing parallels between the dance development process and the technological startup scene.</li>

					I.	You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend as little money as possible.

				<li><b>For a dance piece to be successful, it seems that many things must fall into place.</b></li>
			  </ul>
			  <ul class="content-list right-60">
				<li><b>Startups are a marvel of the modern technological world.</b></li>
				<li>Like Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak selling Apple computers from their garage, Bill Gates founding his company Microsoft, or Tony Hsieh keeping Zappos afloat in the 1990s, a programmer with the right knowledge in the right place at the right time can make a splash in the tech scene.</li>
				<li>That requires a lot of "right"s, though, something that only happens for <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4853121.Mahendra_Ramsinghani ">0.5 percent of the 600,000 startups</a> launched every year.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <div class="clear"></div>
			  <ul class="content-list left-30">
				<li><b>First and foremost, a choreographer needs to "start with good people" – namely, his or her dancers.</b></li>
				<li>At auditions, a choreographer needs to convince dancers that his piece is worth dancing, that he has a vision the dancers can embrace and expand.</li>
				<li>One of the pieces at Works In Progress involves the use of ten-pound weights attached to nylon ropes.</li>
				<li>Morgan came back from auditions one hundred percent certain she did not want to be dancing in that piece.</li>
				<li>She didn't click with the choreographer, she said, and she thought the idea of weights was crazy.</li>
				<li>Investors thought selling shoes online was a wacky idea, too, but Zappos has gone on to make billions of dollars in sales every year since 2008.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <ul class="content-list left-30" style="padding-left: 5%">
				<li><b>Like a good startup CEO, a choreographer must also "make something the customers actually want."</b></li>
				<li>In the case of dance, customers are audience members, and what they want depends on the choreographer's intended audience demographic.</li>
				<li>This point does offer some flexibility, however.</li>
				<li>Just as technological firms have to develop for what the customer actually needs as opposed to what the customer thinks he needs, choreographers can push the boundaries of what the audience members are willing to watch.</li>
				<li>Modern choreographers like Trisha Brown, tired of holding audience members' hands, can develop dances that expand the minds of those watching, just as Apple tries to develop devices that make technology use as intuitive as possible.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <ul class="content-list right-30">
				<li><b>Finally, there is the money situation.</b></li>
				<li>Unless they attract the attention of venture capital (VC) firms or so-called "angel investors," startups have a critically small amount of time in which to succeed or fail.</li>
				<li>Dance groups, unless they can wheedle adequate money from federal and local grants, are on their own to acquire the funds needed to continue dancing.</li>
				<li>There's a saying in tech: "fail fast and fail often."</li>
				<li>That is simply not an option if failing means you can't try again.</li>

Many startups have the same goal in mind: solve Internet search, make a social networking site, create an e-commerce website.  The companies that stand out, however, are those that did it best.  Sixty-seven percent of web searches go through Google ; five hundred million people use Facebook ; Zappos stocks over fifty thousand varieties of shoes, in addition to their non-shoe merchandise .  Lots of companies tried to do web search; lots of companies tried to make networking sites; lots of companies tried to sell merchandise.  The ingredients weren’t new, but the way Google, Facebook, and Zappos stirred them was.
The human body can only move in so many ways before breaking.  Choreographers have a limited, though expansive, set of ingredients with which to work.  It is the way in which they combine the movements that either sends us to sleep or brings us out of our chairs with applause.  Like startup companies, most choreographers focus in on a subset of those movements: ballet with a touch of modern (Balanchine), modern-to-the-point-of-pedestrian (Brown), African movements (Vuyani dance theater), and more.  A choreographer doesn’t need to do everything: she just needs to choreograph her subset of movements well, in a way that connects with her audience.
