			<p class="intro">I'm a full-stack developer who loves a challenge.</p>
			<p>I just graduated from Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.</p>
			<p>I have a solid foundation in Java and C, and I've picked up other languages and front-end experience along the way. If there's something I don't <a href="{{site.skills_link}}">know</a> yet, I'm happy to learn it - I enjoy learning about and using new technologies.</p>
			<p>I'm passionate about tackling challenges and developing efficient solutions that are fun for people to use.</p>
			<p>You can learn more about <a href="{{site.resume_link}}">where I've been</a>, <a href="{{site.skills_link}}">what I know</a>, and <a href="{{site.projects_link}}">what I've worked on</a>.</p>
			<p>If you've got any questions, <a href="{{site.contact_link}}">let me know</a>.</p>
